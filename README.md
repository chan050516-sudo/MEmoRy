# MEmoRy

People move through life too quickly. Most don’t stop to check how they actually feel. Caring for their own emotions becomes an afterthought, and traditional therapy often feels too distant or heavy to approach. Many experience stress, anxiety, or emotional pain, but they can’t name it. They don’t know where it comes from or how to deal with it. Their feelings get buried under noise, routines, and numbness.

**MEmoRy** gives users a simple way to slow down and understand themselves. It lets them chat with AI about their days for diary generation, get AI-generated reflections, track emotional trends, and access meditation content when needed. Everything runs in the browser and stays personal. The goal isn’t to replace therapy, but to offer a quiet space where people can notice their emotions, make sense of them, and take better care of their inner state—one day at a time.

**MEmoRy** is a personal mood tracking and memory recording application that combines daily journaling, emotion visualization, and multimedia experiences. Its main goals are to:
-	Track and manage moods: Provide intuitive feedback on emotional fluctuations through daily records and ratings.
-	Enhance self-awareness: Allow users to review historical data to identify behavioral patterns and emotional triggers.
-	Provide immersive experiences: Use background videos/audio and mindfulness content to help users relax while journaling.
-	Establish inner harmony: Recognizing that all of these emotions, once acknowledged, will transform into precious memories that define our lives and achieve emotional wholeness.

The name **MEmoRy** reflects its core features: EMO (emotion), MEMO (diary), MEMORY, ME, and extends to diaRY and Meditation.

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default defineConfig([
  globalIgnores(['dist']),
  {
    files: ['**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
    extends: [
      // Other configs...

      // Remove tseslint.configs.recommended and replace with this
      tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
      // Alternatively, use this for stricter rules
      tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
      // Optionally, add this for stylistic rules
      tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,

      // Other configs...
    ],
    languageOptions: {
      parserOptions: {
        project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
        tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
      },
      // other options...
    },
  },
])
```

You can also install [eslint-plugin-react-x](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) and [eslint-plugin-react-dom](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) for React-specific lint rules:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import reactX from 'eslint-plugin-react-x'
import reactDom from 'eslint-plugin-react-dom'

export default defineConfig([
  globalIgnores(['dist']),
  {
    files: ['**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
    extends: [
      // Other configs...
      // Enable lint rules for React
      reactX.configs['recommended-typescript'],
      // Enable lint rules for React DOM
      reactDom.configs.recommended,
    ],
    languageOptions: {
      parserOptions: {
        project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
        tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
      },
      // other options...
    },
  },
])
```
